disk_store module implements DiskStorage class which implements the KV store on the
disk

DiskStorage provides two simple operations to get and set key value pairs. Both key
and value need to be of string type, and all the data is persisted to disk.
During startup, DiskStorage loads all the existing KV pair metadata, and it will
throw an error if the file is invalid or corrupt.

Note that if the database file is large, the initialisation will take time
accordingly. The initialisation is also a blocking operation; till it is completed,
we cannot use the database.

Typical usage example:

    disk: DiskStorage = DiskStore(file_name="books.db")
    disk.set(key="othello", value="shakespeare")
    author: str = disk.get("othello")
    # it also supports dictionary style API too:
    disk["hamlet"] = "shakespeare"

# We use `file.seek` method to move our cursor to certain byte offset for read
# or write operations. The method takes two parameters file.seek(offset, whence).
# The offset says the byte offset and whence says the direction:
#
# whence 0 - beginning of the file
# whence 1 - current cursor position
# whence 2 - end of the file

# DiskStorage is a Log-Structured Hash Table as described in the BitCask paper. We
# keep appending the data to a file, like a log. DiskStorage maintains an in-memory
# hash table called KeyDir, which keeps the row's location on the disk.
#
# The idea is simple yet brilliant:
#   - Write the record to the disk
#   - Update the internal hash table to point to that byte offset
#   - Whenever we get a read request, check the internal hash table for the address,
#       fetch that and return
#
# KeyDir does not store values, only their locations.
#
# The above approach solves a lot of problems:
#   - Writes are insanely fast since you are just appending to the file
#   - Reads are insanely fast since you do only one disk seek. In B-Tree backed
#       storage, there could be 2-3 disk seeks
#
# However, there are drawbacks too:
#   - We need to maintain an in-memory hash table KeyDir. A database with a large
#       number of keys would require more RAM
#   - Since we need to build the KeyDir at initialisation, it will affect the startup
#       time too
#   - Deleted keys need to be purged from the file to reduce the file size
